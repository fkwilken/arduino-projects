# arduino-projects
A simple github repo holding the code I've worked on for my Microcontrollers and Robotics Class.

The LCD Game Bluetooth code works with a 16x2 Serial Enabled LCD and a BLE bluetooth device on an arduino. It works as a button or bluetooth controlled game.

The newer version, LCD Game bluetooth IR, adds compatibility for use with an IR sensor.
